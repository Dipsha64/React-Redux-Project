First add action type to perform using redux toolkit.
So added type in action-type.js file.
then set product action using action type in productAction.js file.
then we r going to create reducer in this file. So reducer always take initial state in the Action.
After that combine all the reducers in index.js file using "combineReducers";
Then set store.

**** to connect react application with redux store then use main react - index.js file.
